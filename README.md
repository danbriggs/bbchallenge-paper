# ðŸ¦« Determination of the fifth Busy Beaver value

We prove that $S(5) = 47,176,870$ using the Coq proof assistant. The Busy Beaver value $S(n)$ is the maximum~number of steps that an n-state 2-symbol Turing machine can perform from the all-0 tape before halting and $S$ was historically introduced by \radofull in 1962 as one of the simplest examples of a noncomputable function.  The proof enumerates 181,385,789 Turing machines with 5 states, and, for each machine, decides whether it halts or not.
    Our result marks the first determination of a new Busy Beaver value in over 40 years and the first Busy Beaver value to ever be formally verified, attesting to the effectiveness of massively collaborative online research (\url{bbchallenge.org}).
