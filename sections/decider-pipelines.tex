\subsection{\CoqBB pipelines}\label{sec:pipelines}
A \textit{pipeline} of deciders consists of applying several deciders in sequence: a machine is tested by each decider successively until one decider outputs \HALT or \NONHALT. Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB5} gives an approximation of the pipeline of deciders implemented in \CoqBB in order to decide all the $\BBtheFifthTNF$ enumerated 5-state machines (see Section~\ref{sec:enum}) and that way, conclude that $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ since any machine running more steps is decided \NONHALT, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}. Similarly, Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB2x4} and Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB4} repsectively approximations of the pipelines leading to $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$ and $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$ -- the latter confirming the result for $S(4)$ given in \cite{Brady83}.

The exact pipelines are give in Appendix~\ref{app:pipelines} and only differ in that the precise parameters are given for each decider which are sometimes interleaved with each other (\eg the decider for loops is first called with a small step-count parameter, then other deciders are applied and later on it is called again with higher step-count parameter).

\ts{TS: I'm hesitating to say this early that a subtlelty of the S(5) pipeline is that parameters (or, more "concerning" certificates) are given hardocded for approx 8k machines. Also questionning to say (or repeat) here that WFAR is irregular (as well as some sporadic), which makes a disctinction between S(5) and S(4)/S(2,4).}
