The goal of this decider is to recognise two types of Turing machines: (i) \textit{\cyclers} (see Figure~\ref{fig:loops}~left) that eventually repeat the same configuration and therefore loop forever and (ii) \textit{\TCs} that also eventually repeat the same configuration, but translated in space (see Figure~\ref{fig:loops}~right). We regroup both types of machines under the umbrella term of \textit{loops}.

Deciding Cyclers reduces to the well-known mathematical problem of detecting the cycles of a function and standard detection algorithms exist \cite{wiki:Cycle_detection}, the simplest one consisting in memorizing each successive configuration of the machine until encountering one that has been already seen. Translated Cyclers, also known as \textit{Lin's recurrence}, have first been described and decided in Shen Lin's 1963 PhD thesis \cite{Lin1963}, other algorithms to detect them have been developed since then\footnote{\url{https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/t/decider-translated-cyclers/34}}.

Here, we develop a new algorithm (Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}) for deciding both \cyclers and \TCs. The particularity of this algorithm is that it detects loops only by analysing the history of state, read-symbol and \headposs visited by the machine, instead of considering entire configurations (\ie with full tape content information).

Let's call the \textit{transcript} of a machine the list of successive \ssps visited by the machine from the all-zero tape. For instance, the transcript of the \cycler in Figure~\ref{fig:loops}~(left) starts with \texttt{A0 B0 C0 D0 B1 E0 C0 D0 B0 C1 A0} and the transcript of the \TC in Figure~\ref{fig:loops}~(right) starts with \texttt{A0 B0 C0 A0 B1 D1 C1 E0 C0 A1 C1}. Surprisingly, it turns out that in order to detect loops, we only have to track when a transcript repeats the same sequence twice back-to-back, for instance, in the case of the Cycler in Figure~\ref{fig:loops}: \texttt{A0 B0 C0 D0 B1 E0 C0 D0 B0 C1 A0 B0 C1 A0 B0 C1 A0 B0 C0 D0 \textbf{\underline{B1 E1 C0 D1}} \textbf{\underline{B1 E1 C0 D1}}}. When such a repetition occurs, we use the extra information of \headpos to conclude:

\begin{itemize}
    \item if when entering the second repetition the head is at the same position it was at the beginning of the first repetition, then we have detected a \cycler, \eg for the \cycler in Figure~\ref{fig:loops}~(left), here is the end of the transcript with extra head-position information given after each \ssp: \texttt{\underline{\textbf{B1(-2)} E1(-3) C0(-2) D1(-3)} \underline{\textbf{B1(-2)} E1(-3) C0(-2) D1(-3)}}.

    \item if each time that the \headpos attains a local extremum (\ie a position that is strictly bigger or smaller than any previously seen position, also known as \textit{record-breaking}) in either repetition, it also corresponds to a local extremum in the other repetition, then we have detected a \TC, \eg for the \TC in Figure~\ref{fig:loops}~(right), the transcript (with \headpos information) is: \texttt{A0(0) \underline{B0(1)* C0(2)* A0(1) B1(2) D1(1) C1(2) E0(3)* C0(2) A1(1) C1(2) E1(3)} \\ \underline{B0(4)* C0(5)* A0(4) B1(5) D1(4) C1(5) E0(6)* C0(5) A1(4) C1(5) E1(6)}} etc., with all record-breaking positions marked \texttt{*} in the repeated \ssp pattern \texttt{B0 C0 A0 B1 D1 C1 E0 C0 A1 C1 E1}.

\end{itemize}

This logic is encoded in Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}, l.\ref{alg:loops:test} and we prove that this algorithm is correct in Theorem~\ref{th:loops}.

\begin{theorem}[Coq-BB5: \texttt{Lemma loop1\_decider\_WF}]\label{th:loops}
    Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a Turing machine and $L \in \N^+$ a step-limit. \textsc{decider-loops}($\mathcal{M}$, $L$) terminates and its result is correct -- see Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the result is \texttt{HALT} then $\mathcal{M}$ halts from the all-zero tape.
        \item If the result is \texttt{NONHALT} then $\mathcal{M}$ does not halt from the all-zero tape.
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The call to \textsc{decider-loops}($\mathcal{M}$, $L$) terminates because of Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}, l.\ref{alg:loops:terminate}. The call returns \texttt{HALT} if and only if $\mathcal{M}$ halts within $L$ steps from the all-zero tape, see Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}, l.\ref{alg:loops:halt}, hence if the call returns \texttt{HALT} we know that the machine halts. The interesting case is the loop-detection leading to \texttt{NONHALT}. We leave this case as an exercise for the reader.

    % We take the same terminology than Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}: $h_i = (s_i,m_i,d_i) \in \states \times \alphabet \times \Z$ for $0 \leq i \leq L$ correspond the successive state, read-symbol and tape position reached. Let's assume the algorithm returns \texttt{NONHALT} for some loop length parameter $l \geq 0$: we have $s_{L-i} = s_{K-i}$ and $m_{L-i} = m_{K-i}$ for all $i \in [0,l]$ with $K = L-l-1$ and each $h_{L-i}$ is \textit{record-breaking} (\ie \headpos that is strictly bigger or smaller than any previously seen \headpos) iff $h_{K-i}$ is. Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}, l.\ref{alg:loops:test} distinguishes two cases:

    % \begin{enumerate}
    %   \item $d_L$ is equal to $d_K$. In that case, let's show that $h_{L+1}$ is defined and that $h_{L+1} = h_{K+1}$. Because $s_K = s_L$ and $m_K = m_L$, the machine is in same state and reads same symbol at steps $K$ and $L$, hence the same transition is applied to go from $h_K$ to $h_{K+1}$ than from $h_L$ to $h_{L+1}$, meaning that $s_{L+1} = s_{K+1}$; furthermore, because $d_L = d_{K}$ we have $d_{L+1} = d_{K+1}$. Hence, $h_{L+1}$ is defined (\ie the machine has not halted), but it remains to prove that the read-symbol is the same, \ie $m_{L+1} = m_{K+1}$. First, let's notice than by the same argument we can conclude that $d_{L-i} = d_{K-i}$ for all $i \in [0,l]$. Then, let's consider $i_0 = \text{max}\{i \, | \, d_i = d_{K+1},\, i < L+1\}$. We know that $i_0$ is defined since $i_0 \geq K+1$. Piecing together what we know, we have that $h_{i_0} = h_{i_0 -l - 1}$ and therefore that $m_{L+1} = m_{K+1}$ since there is no step between $i_0$ and $L+1$ where position $d_{L+1}$ is reached, as well as no step between $i_0-l-1$ and $K+1$ where $d_{K+1} = d_{L+1}$ is reached, and the same transition was taken at $h_{i_0} = h_{i_0 -l - 1}$. Hence, $h_{L+1} = h_{K+1}$. Using this reasoning as induction step shows that, for all $i \in \N$ and $i' = i \text{ mod } l+1$, we have $h_{L+i} = h_{K+i'}$. The transcript of $\mathcal{M}$ is infinite, the machine does not halt from the all-zero tape.
    %   \item $d_L$ is not equal to $d_K$ but \headpos records were broken. Let's slightly modify $h_i$ to be $h_i = (s_i,m_i,b_i) \in \states \times \alphabet \times \mathbb{B}$ where $b_i$ being \texttt{true} iff $d_i$ broke a record (\ie if for all $0 \geq j < i$ we have $d_j < d_i$). We know that $h_{L-i} = h_{K-i}$ for all $i \in [0,l]$. Let's show that $h_{L+1}$ is defined and that $h_{L+1} = h_{K+1}$. Similarly as in the first case, because $s_K = s_L$ and $m_K = m_L$ we know that $h_{L+1}$ is defined and $s_{L+1} = s_{K+1}$. Two cases:
    %         \begin{itemize}
    %           \item If $h_{K}$ and $h_{L}$ are record-breaking. If $h_{K+1}$ is record-breaking then so is $h_{L+1}$ because the head move direction is the same from $h_{K}$ to $h_{K+1}$ and $h_{L}$ to $h_{L+1}$. Hence, $m_{L+1} = m_{K+1} = 0$ and we have  $h_{L+1} = h_{K+1}$. If $h_{K+1}$ is not record-breaking, then $h_{L+1}$ is not record-breaking either again because head move directions are the same. In that case, because the cell at position $d_{L+1}$ has already been seen, we can apply the same argument as in case 1 above ($d_L = d_K$) and conclude that $h_{L+1} = h_{K+1}$.
    %           \item If $h_{K}$ and $h_{L}$ are not record-breaking. If $h_{K+1}$ is record-breaking then so is $h_{L+1}$. \ts{TS: TO FINISH}
