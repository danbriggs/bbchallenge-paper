Are there simple \noncomput functions? What is the \textit{smallest} open problem in mathematics? What do algorithms look like, \textit{in the wild}?

Introduced by \radofull in 1962, \textit{the \BBfull game} gives a framework to answer these seemingly independent questions, starting with the first one since \rado's goal was to ``present some very simple instances of \noncomput functions'' \cite{Rado_1962}. The game is as such: (i) run all $n$-state Turing machines\footnote{See Appendix~\ref{app:TMs} for Turing machines definitions and examples.} from the all-zero tape (ii) consider the set of machines that eventually halt (iii) the winner of the game is the halting machine that has the most \sone symbols on its tape when it halts. This maximum number of \sone symbols on halting tape among $n$-state machines is called $\Sigma(n)$. \rado also introduced $S(n)$, the maximum number of steps made by a halting $n$-state Turing machine from all-zero tape. Both functions $\Sigma$ and $S$ are \noncomput! This is most obvious in the case of $S$: if an $n$-state machine runs for more than $S(n)+1$ steps, we know it will never halt, giving an algorithm to decide Turing's halting problem if $S$ was computable. This tight link between $S$ and the halting problem makes it more interesting and practical to us than $\Sigma$, hence we take the liberty to concentrate more on $S$.

%This tight link to the halting problem makes $S$ more interesting and practical to us than $\Sigma$, hence we take the liberty (similarly to other authors \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier,otherexamples?}) to focus the busy beaver game on $S$ instead of $\Sigma$ and to call the $n$-state \textit{busy beaver winner} the machine achieving $S(n)$ running steps. 
While there is no algorithm to compute $S(n)$ for \textit{all} $n$ we can certainly try to compute $S(n)$ for \textit{some} $n$. Prior to this work, only the four first values of $S$ had been proved: $S(1)=1$, $S(2)=6$ \cite{Rado_1962}, $S(3) = 21$ \cite{Lin1963}, $S(4) = 107$ \cite{Brady83}. With some early attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, the $S(5)$ quest seriously started in 1983 with a 2-day competition organised at the University of Dortmund\footnote{Report of the competition: \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/other/lud20.pdf}.} with the sole goal of finding new 5-state champions -- \ie 5-state machines achieving better $S$ scores than any machines previously known \cite{PMichel_website,michel2019busy}. The winning machine in Dortmund achieved $134,467$ steps, establishing $S(5) \geq 134,467$. In 1989, a big step was made when Marxen and Buntrock found a new champion\footnote{\url{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1LC_1RC1RB_1RD0LE_1LA1LD_1RZ0LA} \ts{TS: (to improve with table)}} achieving $\BBtheFifth$ steps \cite{Marxen_1990}, showing $S(5) \geq \BBtheFifth$. However, it remained unknown if no other machine could beat it, \ie whether Marxen and Buntrock's machine was the actual 5-state Busy Beaver winner or not. In 2020, Aaronson conjectured that there was no better 5-state machine, \ie $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

Our main result is to prove this conjecture, using the \Coq proof assistant \cite{the_coq_development_team_2024_14542673}, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}. The winning machine for $S(5)$ is also the winning machine for $\Sigma(5)$. We also prove $\Sigma(5) = \SigmaTheFifth$, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB5Sigma}.

\begin{theorem}\label{th:BB5}
    $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$.
\end{theorem}

The function $S$ can naturally be extended to Turing machines using more than two alphabet symbols \cite{BradyMeaningOfLife}, like, for instance, $S(2,3) = 38$ is the value of $S$ for 2-state, 3-symbol machines \cite{BradyMeaningOfLife, MICHEL200445, LafittePapazian2007}. We also prove, using Coq, that $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB2x4}:

\begin{theorem}\label{th:BB2x4}
    $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$.
\end{theorem}

The Coq proofs for $S(5)$ and $S(2,4)$ --- as well as for previously known $S(2),\,S(3),\,S(4)$ and $S(2,3)$ --- are available at \url{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}. The lists of all the Turing machines evaluated by these proofs are available at \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/CoqBB5_release_v1.0.0/}.

The goal of this paper is to present these proofs. As a result of our work, we now have a clearer view of the landscape of small Busy Beaver values, see Table~\ref{table:landscape}.

\paragraph{Challenges.} Proving $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ required analyzing the behavior of $\BBtheFifthTNF$ Turing machines\footnote{This exact number can only be known after the proof is done, see Section~\ref{sec:TNF}.}-- evidently requiring computer assistance. The challenge for a halting machine is the case where it halts after a number of steps that is too enormous to be simulated step-by-step (e.g. the current 6-state champion halts after $10 \uparrow \uparrow 15$ steps \cite{Pavel_discorvery}, see Appendix~\ref{app:lowerbounds}), this challenge was not met for 5-state machines since they halt in at most $\BBtheFifth$ steps -- this could not have been known for certain in advance but was believed -- which is easy to simulate on modern computers. The challenge for a non-halting machine is that proving it does halt can be hard. How hard?

Dauntingly, any $\Pi_1^0$ mathematical statement\footnote{A $\Pi_1^0$ statement is a statement of first-order logic of the form ``$\forall x, \phi(x)$'' where $\phi$ is a sentence with only bounded quantifiers (\ie $\phi(x)$ can always be verified by a computer in finite time).} can be encoded as the halting problem of a Turing machine (from all-zero tape). Such statements are common and include famous open problems in mathematics such as Goldbach's conjecture or the Riemann hypothesis. Goldbach's conjecture, formulated in 1742, is one of the oldest open problems in mathematics and states ``every even positive integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.'' We can build a Turing machine that halts iff the conjecture is false: by enumerating all positive integers, then for each, test all sums of smaller primes and halt iff we do not find the sum. A (formally verified) machine performing this procedure has been built using only 25 states \cite{GoldbachTM27, GoldbachTM25}. This means that proving the value of $S(25)$ is at least as hard as solving Goldbach's conjecture because the proof of $S(25)$ must contain an argument as of why this particular 25-state machine does not (or, believed less likely, does) halt. Similarly, the Riemann hypothesis has been encoded in a 744-state machine \cite{RiemannTM,Yedidia2016,BusyBeaverFrontier}. As low as 15 states is enough to encode a hard number theoretical conjecture by Erd\H{o}s \cite{BB15}. Worst, the consistency of common axioms sets such as Peano's Arithmetic (PA) or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) is also $\Pi_1^0$ since one can enumerate proofs in these systems until the proof of a contradiction is found. This has been done for ZF, using 748 states \cite{ZFTM,Yedidia2016,BusyBeaverFrontier,BB748Thesis}. By G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem, this means that proving the value of $S(748)$ cannot be done using ZF. Aaronson conjectures that as low as $S(20)$ cannot be proven in ZF and as low as $S(10)$ cannot be proven in PA \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

Hence, while 5-state halting machines were not feared, it remained unknown how hard non-halting 5-state machines could get. This article settles the question: the smallest open problem in mathematics (on the Busy Beaver scale) does not arise from 5-state machines -- but we have good contenders for 6-state machines, see Section~\ref{sec:cryptids}.

\paragraph{Related Work.} The proof of $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$ was published in 1983 \cite{Brady83}. One of its main innovations was the introduction of a method to solve the halting problem of a category of machines the author calls \textit{XMas Trees}. A caveat of \cite{Brady83} resides in the following quote from the paper: ``All of the remaining holdouts were examined by means of voluminous printouts of their histories along with some program extracted features. It was determined to the author's satisfaction that none of these machines will ever stop.'' A \textit{holdout} is a machine still needing a proof of halting/nonhalting. Using Coq, we bring additional confirmation that $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB4}.

\newcommand{\SkeletHoldoutsSporadic}{\ts{XX}\xspace}

We know of two attempts at solving $S(5)$: in 2003, Georgi Georgiev (also known under pseudonym ``Skelet'' or ``Skeleta'') published the program \texttt{bbfind} \cite{Skelet_bbfind} which enumerates and decides the halting behavior of 5-state Turing machines, claiming to leave unsolved mainly 43 holdouts\footnote{\url{https://skelet.ludost.net/bb/nreg.html} and \url{https://bbchallenge.org/skelet}}. Attesting to the validity of the result is difficult as Skelet's code consists of ca. 6000 lines of uncommented and undocumented Pascal. That said, it turned out to be instrumental for our result as, after reverse engineering parts of it, we were able to learn and improve on his ``Closed Position Set'' technique (see Section~\ref{sec:n-gramCPS}) which improvements decided slightly more than 99.87\% of the 5-state Turing machines excluding loops (see Section~\ref{sec:loops}). All of our \numSporadic \textit{Sporadic Machines}, \ie machines for which we needed individual proofs of nonhalting, were either among Skelet's 43 holdouts or claimed to have been manually solved by him. See Section~\ref{sec:sporadic} for more discussion on our analyses of these longstanding holdouts. Some of Skelet's list of 43 holdouts were analysed by hand prior to our work \cite{DanBriggs}. The second known attempt at $S(5)$ was in 2008 with Hertel's ``Symbolic induction prover'', which claimed to leave only $1{,}000$ holdouts, $900$ of which were manually proven not to halt, allegedly leaving only $100$ proper holdouts \cite{Hertel}. In an opposite way to Skelet's work, the method is documented but, to the best of our knowledge, no code is made available, nor are the 900 claimed manual proofs, making verification of the result difficult apart from reproduction from scratch (arguably, verification would still be tedious if the 900 proofs were given).

The \BBfull problem was also studied in other models of computation than \rado's (c.f. Appendix~\ref{app:TMs}), including the \textit{quadruple} variation of Turing machines where each transition may move or write a new symbol, but not both \cite{Ross2003,Ross2005}. For additional historical perspective on the \BBfull problem, we refer the reader to Michel's survey and website \cite{michel2019busy,PMichel_website}.

\paragraph{Structure of the proof: overview.} Machines are enumerated arborescently in \textit{Tree Normal Form} (TNF) \cite{Brady64} which drastically reduces the search space's size -- \eg from ca. 10 trillion machines to $\BBtheFifthTNF$ for 5-state machines, see Section~\ref{sec:enum}.

Each enumerated machine is fed through a sequence (or \textit{pipeline}) of \textit{deciders}, where a decider is an algorithm trying to decide whether the machine halts or not. Because of the noncomputability of the halting problem, there is no \textit{universal} decider but all the craft resides in creating deciders able to decide large families of machines, in reasonable time. The $S(5)$ pipeline of deciders is given in Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB5} -- see Tab~\ref{tab:pipelineBB2x4} for $S(2,4)$. Deciders are presented in Section~\ref{sec:deciders}. To the best of our knowledge, all the deciders we present are original.

In the case of 5-state machines, \numSporadic \textit{Sporadic Machines} were not solved by deciders and required individual proofs of nonhalting, see Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}. These machines include suprising behaviours, such as eventually-repeating chaos (machine ``Skelet \#1''), base-Fibonacci counters (machine ``Skelet \#10''), or obfuscated Gray code (machine ``Skelet \#17'') and they are beautiful examples of \textit{algorithms in the wild}: non-human-engineered algorithms that, like deep sea life, were only found by means of exploration.

\paragraph{Collaboratively solving the problem: bbchallenge.org.} In 2022, Stérin created ``The Busy Beaver Challenge'', \url{bbchallenge.org}, an online platform dedicated to collaboratively solving ``$S(5)=\BBtheFifth$'' \cite{sterin_2022_14955828}. Collaboration was motivated by the great amount of Turing machines to study in order to solve the problem. The bbchallenge platform essentially consists of the website, an instant chat server\footnote{\url{https://discord.gg/3uqtPJA9Uv}}, and, a wiki\footnote{\url{wiki.bbchallenge.org}}. The website serves as an entry-point to the problem and was providing a browsable \textit{seed database}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/bbchallenge/bbchallenge-seed}} containing a set of 5-state Turing machines to prove nonhalting in order to solve $S(5)$. Using this database, the task of contributors was to design deciders (see above). For both the seed database and deciders, trust in the results required a strict validation process: (i) any algorithm had to be reproduced at least once by an independent contributor, with matching results, (ii) a proof of correctness had to be provided (in natural language, like a regular mathematical article). Over the span of two years, collaborators organically joined the project and contributed to deciders naturally, where their skills and interests applied the most, without any vertical research management structure. Most of the collaboration and interactions happened asynchronously on our (rather entropic) instant chat server, which, at the time of this writing has about 800 members and 20 active daily.  Some core members of the project are anonymous. Most members do not work in academia (or are undergraduate students). With the surprise release of \CoqBB in the spring of 2024 (see below), both the seed database and the validation process were made obsolete, but almost all the collaborative work performed on \url{bbchallenge.org} during these 2 years was embedded in the Coq proof. See the discussion, Section~\ref{sec:intro:discuss}, for comparison of bbchallenge with other collaborative research projects.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The website serves as an entry-point to the problem with, in particular, the ability to browse the space of Turing machines, visualise them, and access them individually by URL. The website was also tracking the remaining number of undecided 5-state Turing machines.
%     \item The instant chat server is the main communication tool, it played an instrumental role in many collaborative discoveries that were either made or announced there. The style of this chat is rather entropic with no limitations on members to talk about whichever scientific topic they want. At the time of this writing the chat server has about 800 members and about 20 active daily.
%     \item The GitHub organisation contains the official repositories of the project (\eg website, this paper, deciders, etc...).
%     \item The wiki allows for long-term conservation of knowledge.
%     \item The forum is used for slower-paced style of conversations and official announcements. The forum is quite inactive.
% \end{itemize}


\paragraph{Formal Verification (\Coq and \CoqBB).} Our work is the first to formally verify a \BBfull value.
