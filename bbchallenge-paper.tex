In 1962, \radofull introduced \textit{the \BBfull game} in an effort to ``present some very simple instances of \noncomput functions'' \cite{Rado_1962}. The game is as such: (i) run all $n$-state Turing machines\footnote{See Appendix~\ref{app:TMs} for Turing machines definitions and examples.} from the all-zero tape (ii) consider the set of machines that eventually halt (iii) the winner of the game is the halting machine that has the most \sone symbols on its tape when it halts. This maximum number of \sone symbols on halting tape among $n$-state machines is called $\Sigma(n)$. The other function introduced by \rado is called $S$ and $S(n)$ is the maximum number of steps made by a halting $n$-state Turing machine from all-zero tape. Both functions $\Sigma$ and $S$ are \noncomput! The most obvious is the case of $S$: if an $n$-state machine runs for more than $S(n)+1$ steps, we know it will never halt, giving an algorithm to decide Turing's halting problem if $S$ was computable. This tight link between $S$ and the halting problem makes it more interesting and practical to us than $\Sigma$, hence we take the liberty (similarly to other authors \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier,otherexamples?}) to focus this article more on
$S$ than $\Sigma$.

%This tight link to the halting problem makes $S$ more interesting and practical to us than $\Sigma$, hence we take the liberty (similarly to other authors \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier,otherexamples?}) to focus the busy beaver game on $S$ instead of $\Sigma$ and to call the $n$-state \textit{busy beaver winner} the machine achieving $S(n)$ running steps. 
Prior to this work, only the four first values of $S$ had been proved: $S(1)=1$, $S(2)=6$ \cite{Rado_1962}, $S(3) = 21$ \cite{Lin1963}, $S(4) = 107$ \cite{Brady83}. With some early attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, the $S(5)$ quest seriously started in 1983 with a 2-day competition organised at the university of Dortmund\footnote{Report of the competition: \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/other/lud20.pdf}.} with sole goal to find new 5-state champions -- \ie 5-state machines achieving better $S$ scores than previously known ones \cite{PMichel_website,michel2019busy}. The best machine achieved $134,467$ steps, establishing $S(5) \geq 134,467$. A big step was then made in 1989 when Marxen and Buntrock found a new champion\footnote{\url{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1LC_1RC1RB_1RD0LE_1LA1LD_1RZ0LA} \ts{TS: (to improve with table)}} achieving $\BBtheFifth$ steps \cite{Marxen_1990}, showing $S(5) \geq \BBtheFifth$. However, it remained unknown if no other machine could beat it, \ie whether Marxen and Buntrock's 5-state machine was the actual winner or not. In 2020, Aaronson conjectured that there is no better 5-state machine, \ie $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

Our main result is to prove this conjecture, using the \Coq theorem prover \cite{the_coq_development_team_2024_14542673}, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}:

\begin{theorem}\label{th:BB5}
    $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$.
\end{theorem}

The winning machine for $S(5)$ is also the winning machine for $\Sigma(5)$ and we prove $\Sigma(5) = \SigmaTheFifth$, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB5Sigma}. Also, the function $S$ can naturally be extended to Turing machines using more than two alphabet symbols \cite{BradyMeaningOfLife}, where, for instance, $S(5,2)$ is the value of $S$ for 5-state, 2-symbol machines, \ie $S(5)$. It was previously known that $S(2,3) = 38$ \cite{BradyMeaningOfLife, MICHEL200445, LafittePapazian2007}. We also prove, using the Coq theorem prover \cite{the_coq_development_team_2024_14542673}, that $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB24}:

\begin{theorem}\label{th:BB24}
    $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$.
\end{theorem}

The Coq proofs are available at \url{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}. The goal of this paper is to present these proofs. As a result of our work, we now have a clearer view of the small Busy Beaver values landscape, see Table~\ref{table:landscape}.

\paragraph{Challenges.} Proving $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ required to analyse the behavior of $\BBtheFifthTNF$ Turing machines\footnote{This exact number can only be known after the proof is done, see Section~\ref{sec:TNF}.}, which in itself is a challenge -- evidently requiring computer assistance. The challenge for a halting machine is the case where it halts after a number of steps that is too enormous to be simulated step-by-step (e.g. the current 6-state champion halts after $10 \uparrow \uparrow 15$ steps \cite{Pavel_discorvery}, see Appendix~\ref{app:lowerbounds}), this challenge was not met for 5-state machines since they halt in at most $\BBtheFifth$ steps -- this could not have been known in advance but was believed -- which is easy to simulate on modern computers. The challenge for a non-halting machine is that proving it does halt can be hard. How hard?

Dauntingly, any $\Pi_1^0$ mathematical statement\footnote{A $\Pi_1^0$ statement is a statement of first-order logic of the form $\forall x, \phi(x)$ where $\phi$ is a sentence with only bounded quantifiers.} can be encoded as the halting problem of a Turing machine (from all-zero tape). Such statements are common and include famous open problems in mathematics such as Goldbach's conjecture or the Riemann hypothesis. Goldbach's conjecture, formulated in 1742, is one of the oldest open problems in mathematics and states that ``every even positive integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers''. We can build a Turing machine that halts iff the conjecture is false: by enumerating all positive integers, then for each, test all sums for small primes and halt iff we do not find the sum. This has been done in practice (and formally verified) using only 25 states \cite{GoldbachTM27, GoldbachTM25}. This means that proving the value of $S(25)$ is at least as hard as solving Goldbach's conjecture because the proof of $S(25)$ must contain an argument as of why this particular 25-state machine does not (or, believed less likely, does) halt. The Riemann hypothesis has been encoded in an 744-state machines \cite{RiemannTM,Yedidia2016,BusyBeaverFrontier}. As low as 15 states is enough to encode a hard number theoretical conjecture by Erd\H{o}s \cite{BB15}. Worst, the consistency of common axioms sets such as Peano's Arithmetic (PA) or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) is also a  $\Pi_1^0$ since one can enumerate proofs in these systems until the proof of a contradiction is found. This has been done for ZF, using 748 states \cite{ZFTM,Yedidia2016,BusyBeaverFrontier,BB748Thesis}. By G\"odel's second incompletness theorem, this means that proving the value of $S(748)$ cannot be done using ZF and Aaronson conjectures that as low as $S(20)$ cannot be proven in ZF and as low as $S(10)$ cannot be proven in PA \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

Hence, while 5-state halting machines were not feared, it remained completely unknown how hard could non-halting 5-state machines could get. This article settles the question.

\paragraph{Related Work.} The proof of $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$ was published in 1983 \cite{Brady83}. A caveat of the proof resides in the following quote: ``All of the remaining holdouts were examined by means of voluminous printouts of their histories along with some program extracted features. It was determined to the author's satisfaction that none of these machines will ever stop.'' -- where \textit{holdout} means a machine needing of proof of halting/nonhalting. Using the Coq theorem prover, we confirm that the result is correct, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB4}.

\newcommand{\SkeletHoldoutsSporadic}{\ts{XX}\xspace}

We know of two attempts at solving $S(5)$: in 2003, Georgi Georgiev (also known under pseudonym ``Skelet'' or ``Skeleta'') published the program \texttt{bbfind} \cite{Skelet_bbfind} which enumerates and decides the halting behavior of 5-state Turing machines, claiming to leave unsolved mainly 43 holdouts\footnote{\url{https://skelet.ludost.net/bb/nreg.html} and \url{https://bbchallenge.org/skelet}}. Attesting to the validity of the result is difficult as Skelet's code consists of ca. 6000 lines of uncommented and undocumented Pascal. That said, it turned out to be instrumental for our result as, after reverse engineering parts of it, we were able to learn and improve on his ``Closed Position Set'' technique (see Section~\ref{sec:n-gramCPS}) which decided slightly more than 99.87\% of the 5-state Turing machines excluding loops (see Section~\ref{sec:loops}). Also, \SkeletHoldoutsSporadic of his 43 holdouts ended up being part of our \textit{sporadic machines}, \ie machines for which we needed individual proofs of nonhalting, including machine Skelet \#1 and Skelet \#17 who were particularly hard to prove, see Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}. These facts give credit to the trustworthiness of Skelet's list of 43 holdouts, and some of these holdouts were analysed by hand prior to our work \cite{DanBriggs}. The second attempt was in 2008 with Joachim Hertel's ``Symbolic induction prover'' which claimed to leave only $1{,}000$ holdouts $900$ of them manually proven not to halt, allegedly leaving only $100$ proper holdouts \cite{Hertel}. In an opposite way to Skelet's work, the method is documented but, to the best of our knowledge, no code is made available, nor are the 900 claimed manual proofs making verification of the result difficult apart from reproduction from scratch (arguably, verification would still be tedious if the 900 proofs were given).
