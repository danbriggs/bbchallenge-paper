  abstract   = {The Busy Beaver function, with its incomprehensibly rapid growth, has captivated generations of computer scientists, mathematicians, and hobbyists. In this survey, I o er a personal view of the BB function 58 years after its introduction, emphasizing lesser-known insights, recent progress, and especially favorite open problems. Examples of such problems include: when does the BB function rst exceed the Ackermann function? Is the value of BB(20) independent of set theory? Can we prove that BB(n + 1) > 2BB(n) for large enough n? Given BB(n), how many advice bits are needed to compute BB(n + 1)? Do all Busy Beavers halt on all inputs, not just the 0 input? Is it decidable, given n, whether BB(n) is even or odd?},

  abstract  = {From the Publisher:Michael Sipser's philosophy in writing this book is simple: make the subject interesting and relevant, and the students will learn. His emphasis on unifying computer science theory - rather than offering a collection of low-level details - sets the book apart, as do his intuitive explanations. Throughout the book, Sipser - a noted authority on the theory of computation - builds students' knowledge of conceptual tools used in computer science, the aesthetic sense they need to create elegant systems, and the ability to think through problems on their own. INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF COMPUTATION provides a mathematical treatment of computation theory grounded in theorems and proofs. Proofs are presented with a "proof idea" component to reveal the concepts underpinning the formalism. Algorithms are presented using prose instead of pseudocode to focus attention on the algorithms themselves, rather than on specific computational models. Topic coverage, terminology, and order of presentation are traditional for an upper-level course in computer science theory. Users of the Preliminary Edition (now out of print) will be interested to note several new chapters on complexity theory: Chapter 8 on space complexity; Chapter 9 on provable intractability, and Chapter 10 on advanced topics, including approximation algorithms, alternation, interactive proof systems, cryptography, and parallel computing.}

On the periphery, a modem generation of technologists seems unable to conceive of a time when “computer” meant “a person who computes” and the concept of “programming” was not ubiquitous. For practical reasons, a modem computer is much more complex than is minimally necessary to achieve universality. The original formulation of a Universal Computing Machine (Turing 1936-7) involved a table based upon 15 symbols and 28 states with no restriction imposed on the length of a sequence of atomic acts (“move” and “print”) permitted prior to a change in state. An aboriginal use of macros simplified the description.},

Tile Automata was recently introduced combining features of both Cellular Automata and the 2-Handed Model of self-assembly both capable of universal computation. In this work we study the complexity of Tile Automata utilizing features inherited from the two models mentioned above. We first present a construction for simulating Turing machines that performs both covert and fuel efficient computation. We then explore the capabilities of limited Tile Automata systems such as 1-dimensional systems (all assemblies are of height 1) and freezing systems (tiles may not repeat states). Using these results we provide a connection between the problem of finding the largest uniquely producible assembly using n states and the busy beaver problem for non-freezing systems and provide a freezing system capable of uniquely assembling an assembly whose length is exponential in the number of states of the system. We finish by exploring the complexity of the Unique Assembly Verification problem in Tile Automata with different limitations such as freezing and systems without the power of detachment.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a series of results which show separations between the standard seeded model of self-assembly, Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), and the “seedless” 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM), which incorporates the dynamics of hierarchical self-assembly. In particular, we focus on the problem of self-assembling various shapes while minimizing the sizes of tile sets, or “programs”, in each of these models in order to compare and contrast the models. A high-level overview of a subset of these results was presented in a paper by the authors in STACS 2013, but in this version we expand and improve the set of results related to showing separations between the two models according to their abilities to self-assemble various shapes. We exhibit classes of finite shapes that can be self-assembled more efficiently in each model. We also demonstrate infinite shapes that can self-assemble in one model but not in the other, as well as a shape which cannot self-assemble in either model.}

  abstract = {The Chemical Reaction Network model has been proposed as a programming language for molecular programming. Methods to implement arbitrary CRNs using DNA strand displacement circuits have been investigated, as have methods to prove the correctness of those or other implementations. However, the stochastic Chemical Reaction Network model is provably not deterministically Turing-universal, that is, it is impossible to create a stochastic CRN where a given output molecule is produced if and only if an arbitrary Turing machine accepts. A DNA stack machine that can simulate arbitrary Turing machines with minimal slowdown deterministically has been proposed, but it uses unbounded polymers that cannot be modeled as a Chemical Reaction Network. We propose an extended version of a Chemical Reaction Network that models unbounded linear polymers made from a finite number of monomers. This Polymer Reaction Network model covers the DNA stack machine, as well as copy-tolerant Turing machines and some examples from biochemistry. We adapt the bisimulation method of verifying DNA implementations of Chemical Reaction Networks to our model, and use it to prove the correctness of the DNA stack machine implementation. We define a subclass of single-locus Polymer Reaction Networks and show that any member of that class can be bisimulated by a network using only four primitives, suggesting a method of DNA implementation. Finally, we prove that deciding whether an implementation is a bisimulation is Π20-complete, and thus undecidable in the general case, although it is tractable in many special cases of interest. We hope that the ability to model and verify implementations of Polymer Reaction Networks will aid in the rational design of molecular systems.}
