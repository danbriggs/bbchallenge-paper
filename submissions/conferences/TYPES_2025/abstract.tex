Introduced by \radofull in 1962 as part of the \textit{Busy Beaver game} \cite{Rado_1962}, $S(n)$ is the maximum number of steps that a halting $n$-state 2-symbol Turing machine\footnote{Turing machines with one bi-infinite tape.} can do from the all-0 tape before halting. The function $S$ is noncomputable as it would otherwise allow to solve the 
halting problem: run an $n$-state machine for $S(n)+1$ steps and, if it has not halted by then, you know it will never halt.

As $S$ in noncomputable, there is no algorithm that computes \textit{all} of its values, but one can still try to determine \textit{some} of them. We can get a sense of how hard this is by noting that, for instance, there is a 25-state 2-symbol Turing machine \cite{GoldbachTM27,GoldbachTM25} that iterates all natural numbers in search of a counterexample to Goldbach's conjecture\footnote{The conjecture states that every natural number $n>2$ can be written as the sum of two primes. This is one of the oldest open problems in mathematics.}, and halt iff one is found (\ie iff the conjecture is false), which means that proving the value of $S(\geq 25)$ is at least as hard as proving or disproving Goldbach's conjecture. Worse, this idea can be generalised to any other $\Pi_1$ statement\footnote{\ie a logical statement of the form ``For all $x$, $\phi(x)$'' with $\phi$ using only bounded quantifiers meaning that a computer can check $\phi(x)$ in finite time for any $x$.}, such as Riemann Hypothesis or ZF's consistency which have been respectively reduced to $S(744)$ and $S(748)$ \cite{RiemannTM,Yedidia2016,ZFTM,Yedidia2016,BusyBeaverFrontier,BB748Thesis}. 
%Aaronson conjectures that as low as $S(10)$ is independent of Peano \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

Nonetheless, researchers have embarked on the quest of finding what is the biggest value of $S$ we can know. Motivation include: (i) trying to find the simplest open problem in mathematics on the Busy Beaver scale by exhibiting an $n$-state Turing machine for which it is unknown whether it halts or not but $S(n-1)$ is known (\ie the halting status of all $n-1$-state Turing machines is known) and (ii) studying compute \textit{in the wild} by having to understand (to some extent) the behavior of small, not human-engineered, Turing machines which often implement \textit{quirky} algorithms in a \textit{quirky} way.


Prior to this work, only the four first values of $S$ had been proved: $S(1)=1$, $S(2)=6$ \cite{Rado_1962}, $S(3) = 21$ \cite{Lin1963}, $S(4) = 107$ \cite{Brady83}. After some early attempts in the 1960s and 1970s~\cite{PMichel_website,michel2019busy}, the search for $S(5)$ took a turn in 1989 when Marxen and Buntrock found a new 5-state champion\footnote{\url{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1LC_1RC1RB_1RD0LE_1LA1LD_1RZ0LA}} achieving $\BBtheFifth$ steps \cite{Marxen_1990}, thus showing $S(5) \geq \BBtheFifth$. In 2020, after thirty years without improvements, Aaronson conjectured that there is no better 5-state machine, \ie $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

Our main result is to prove this conjecture, using the \Coq proof assistant\footnote{The \Coq proof assistant has been renamed Rocq.} \cite{Coq8.20}:

\begin{theorem*}[\texttt{Lemma BB5\_value}]
  $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$.
\end{theorem*}

The proof, called \CoqBB, is available at \url{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}.




% in general with the following observation: any $\Pi_1$ statement, that is, a logical statement of the form ``For all $x$, $\phi(x)$'' with $\phi$ using only bounded quantifiers\footnote{Hence, a program can check $\phi(x)$ in finite time for any $x$.}, can be encoded as the halting problem of a Turing machine such that the statement is false if and only if the machine halts from all-0 tape. Indeed, it is enough to enumerate each $x$, test $\phi(x)$ on it and, if it does not hold, a counterexample is found and we can halt.
